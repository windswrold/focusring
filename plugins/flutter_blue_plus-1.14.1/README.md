## Introduction

FlutterBluePlus is a Bluetooth Low Energy plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). 

It supports BLE Central Role only (most common). 

If you need BLE Peripheral Role, you should check out [FlutterBlePeripheral](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_ble_peripheral).

## ‚ùó Bluetooth Classic is not supported ‚ùó

 i.e. speakers, headphones, mice, keyboards, gamepads, Arduino HC-05 & HC-06, and more are not supported. These all use Bluetooth Classic.

## Cross-Platform Bluetooth Low Energy

FlutterBluePlus aims to offer the most from all supported platforms: iOS, macOS, Android.

The code is written to be simple, robust, and incredibly easy to understand.

## No Dependencies

FlutterBluePlus has zero dependencies besides Flutter, Android, and iOS themselves.

This makes FlutterBluePlus very stable.

## Usage

### Error Handling :fire:

Flutter Blue Plus takes error handling very seriously. 

Every error returned by the native platform is checked and thrown as an exception where appropriate. See [Reference](#reference) for a list of throwable functions.

**Streams:** At the time of writing, streams returned by Flutter Blue Plus never emit any errors and never close. There's no need to handle `onError` or `onDone` for  `stream.listen(...)`.

---

### Set Log Level

```dart
// your terminal may not support color 
// (i.e. you'll see logs of '\x1B[1;35m' characters)
FlutterBluePlus.setLogLevel(LogLevel.verbose, color:false)
```

Setting `LogLevel.verbose` shows *all* data in and out.

‚ö´ = function name

üü£ = args to platform

üü° = data from platform

### Enable Bluetooth

**Note:** On iOS, a "*This app would like to use Bluetooth*" system dialogue appears the first time you call any FlutterBluePlus method because the underlying `CBCentralManager` on iOS, and `BluetoothManager` on Android classes are initialized.
 
```dart
// check adapter availability
if (await FlutterBluePlus.isAvailable == false) {
    print("Bluetooth not supported by this device");
    return;
}

// turn on bluetooth ourself if we can
// for iOS, the user controls bluetooth enable/disable
if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    await FlutterBluePlus.turnOn();
}

// wait bluetooth to be on & print states
// note: for iOS the initial state is typically BluetoothAdapterState.unknown
// note: if you have permissions issues you will get stuck at BluetoothAdapterState.unauthorized
await FlutterBluePlus.adapterState.map((s){print(s);return s;}).where((s) => s == BluetoothAdapterState.on).first;
```

### Scan for devices

If your device is not found, see [Common Problems](#common-problems).

```dart
// Setup Listener for scan results
// device not found? see "Common Problems" in the README
var subscription = FlutterBluePlus.scanResults.listen((results) {
    for (ScanResult r in results) {
        print('${r.device.localName} found! rssi: ${r.rssi}');
    }
});

// Start scanning
FlutterBluePlus.startScan(timeout: Duration(seconds: 4));

// Stop scanning
await FlutterBluePlus.stopScan();
```

### Connect to a device

```dart
// Connect to the device
await device.connect();

// Disconnect from device
device.disconnect();
```

### Discover services

```dart
List<BluetoothService> services = await device.discoverServices();
services.forEach((service) {
    // do something with service
});
```

### Read and write characteristics

```dart
// Reads all characteristics
var characteristics = service.characteristics;
for(BluetoothCharacteristic c in characteristics) {
    List<int> value = await c.read();
    print(value);
}

// Writes to a characteristic
await c.write([0x12, 0x34])
```

If you want write large messages regardless of mtu, define this function.

```dart
import 'dart:math';

// split large writes
// Note: This can only be used for write (with response) to avoid data loss
extension WriteLarge on BluetoothCharacteristic {
  Future<void> writeLarge(List<int> value, int mtu, {int timeout = 15}) async {
    int chunk = mtu-3;
    for (int i = 0; i < value.length; i += chunk) {
      List<int> subvalue = value.sublist(i, max(i + chunk, value.length));
      write(subvalue, withoutResponse:false, timeout: timeout);
    }
  }
}
```

### Read and write descriptors

```dart
// Reads all descriptors
var descriptors = characteristic.descriptors;
for(BluetoothDescriptor d in descriptors) {
    List<int> value = await d.read();
    print(value);
}

// Writes to a descriptor
await d.write([0x12, 0x34])
```

### Set notifications and listen to changes

If onValueReceived is never called, see [Common Problems](#common-problems) in the README.

```dart
// Setup Listener for characteristic reads
// If this is never called, see "Common Problems" in the README
characteristic.onValueReceived.listen((value) {
    // do something with new value
});

// enable notifications
await characteristic.setNotifyValue(true);
```

### Get Connected System Devices

These devices are already connected to the system, but must be reconnected by *your app* before you can communicate with them.

```dart
List<BluetoothDevice> connectedSystemDevices = await FlutterBluePlus.connectedSystemDevices;
for (var d in connectedSystemDevices) {
    await d.connect(); // Must connect *our* app to the device
    await d.discoverServices();
}
```

### Read the MTU and request larger size

```dart
final mtu = await device.mtu.first;
await device.requestMtu(512);
```

Note that iOS will not allow requests of MTU size, and will always try to negotiate the highest possible MTU (iOS supports up to MTU size 185)

## Getting Started

### Change the minSdkVersion for Android

flutter_blue_plus is compatible only from version 21 of Android SDK so you should change this in **android/app/build.gradle**:

```dart
Android {
  defaultConfig {
     minSdkVersion: 21
```

### Add permissions for Android (No Location)

In the **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** add:

```xml
<!-- Tell Google Play Store that your app uses Bluetooth LE
     Set android:required="true" if bluetooth is necessary -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="false" />

<!-- New Bluetooth permissions in Android 12
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/bluetooth-permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />

<!-- legacy for Android 11 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>

<!-- legacy for Android 9 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
```

### Add permissions for Android (With Fine Location)

If you want to use Bluetooth to determine location.

In the **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** add:

```xml
<!-- Tell Google Play Store that your app uses Bluetooth LE
     Set android:required="true" if bluetooth is necessary -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="false" />

<!-- New Bluetooth permissions in Android 12
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/bluetooth-permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

<!-- legacy for Android 11 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />

<!-- legacy for Android 9 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
```

And set androidUsesFineLocation when scanning:
```dart
// Start scanning
flutterBlue.startScan(timeout: Duration(seconds: 4), androidUsesFineLocation: true);
```

### Android Proguard

Add the following line in your `project/android/app/proguard-rules.pro` file:

```
-keep class com.boskokg.flutter_blue_plus.* { *; }
```

to avoid seeing the following kind errors in your `release` builds:

```
PlatformException(startScan, Field androidScanMode_ for m0.e0 not found. Known fields are
 [private int m0.e0.q, private b3.b0$i m0.e0.r, private boolean m0.e0.s, private static final m0.e0 m0.e0.t,
 private static volatile b3.a1 m0.e0.u], java.lang.RuntimeException: Field androidScanMode_ for m0.e0 not found
```

### Add permissions for iOS

In the **ios/Runner/Info.plist** let‚Äôs add:

```dart
	<dict>
	    <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need BLE permission</string>
	    <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need BLE permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
```

For location permissions on iOS see more at: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/requesting_authorization_for_location_services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/requesting_authorization_for_location_services)

## Debugging

The easiest way to debug issues in FlutterBluePlus is to make your own local copy.

```
cd /user/downloads
git clone https://github.com/boskokg/flutter_blue_plus.git
```

then in `pubspec.yaml` add the repo by path:

```
  flutter_blue_plus:
    path: /user/downloads/flutter_blue_plus
```

Now you can edit the FlutterBluePlus code yourself.

## Common Problems

Many common problems are easily solved.

---

### Scanning does not find my device

**1. your device uses bluetooth classic, not BLE.**

Headphones, speakers, keyboards, mice, gamepads, & printers all use Bluetooth Classic. 

These devices may be found in System Settings, but they cannot be connected to by FlutterBluePlus. FlutterBluePlus only supports Bluetooth Low Energy.

**2. your device stopped advertising.**

- you might need to reboot your device
- you might need put your device in "discovery mode"
- your phone may have already connected automatically
- another app may have already connected to your device
- another phone may have already connected to your device

Try looking through already connected devices:

```dart
// search already connected devices, including devices
// connected to by other apps
List<BluetoothDevice> system = await FlutterBluePlus.connectedSystemDevices;
for (var d in system) {
    print('${r.device.localName} already connected to! ${r.device.remoteId}');
    if (d.localName == "myBleDevice") {
         await r.connect(); // must connect our app
    }
}
```

**3. your scan filters are wrong.**

- try removing all scan filters
- for `withServices` to work, your device must actively advertise the serviceUUIDs it supports


**4. try a ble scanner app**

Search the App Store for a BLE scanner apps. 

You should check if they can discover your device.

---

### Connection fails

**1. Your ble device may be low battery**

Bluetooth can become erratic when your peripheral device is low battery.

**2. Your ble device may have refused the connection or have a bug**

Connection is a two-way process. Your ble device may be misconfigured.

**3. You may be on the edge of the Bluetooth range.**

The signal is too weak, or there are a lot of devices causing radio interference.

**4. Some phones have an issue connecting while scanning.**

The Huawei P8 Lite is one of the reported phones to have this issue. Try stopping your scanner before connecting.

**5. Try restarting your phone**

Bluetooth is a complicated system service, and can enter a bad state.

---

### onValueReceived is never called

**1. you are not subscribed OR not calling read**

Your device will only send values after you call `await characteristic.setNotifyValue(true)`, or `await characteristic.read()`

**2. you are calling write**

`onValueReceived` is only called for reads & notifies.

You can do a single read with `await characteristic.read(...)`

**3. your device has nothing to send**

If you are using `setNotifyValue`, your device chooses when to send data.

Try interacting with your device to get it to send new data.

**4. your device has bugs**

Try rebooting your ble device. 

Some ble devices have buggy software and stop sending data.

---

### characteristic writes fails

**1. the characeristic is not writeable**

Not all characeristics support `write`.
 
Your device must have configured this characteristic to support `write`.

**2. the data length is too long**

Characteristics only support writes up to a certain size. 

`writeWithoutResponse`: you can only write up to (MTU-3) at a time. This is a BLE limitation.

`write`: look in the [Usage](#usage) section for a `writeLarge` function you can use to solve this issue.

**3. the characeristic does not support writeWithoutResponse**

Not all characeristics support `writeWithoutResponse`. 
 
Your device must have configured this characteristic to support `writeWithoutResponse`.

**4. your bluetooth device turned off, or is out of range**

If your device turns off mid-write, it will cause a failure.

**5. your bluetooth device has bugs**

Maybe your device crashed, or is not sending a response due to software bugs.

**6. there is radio interference**

Bluetooth is wireless and will not always work.

---

### characteristic read fails

**1. the characeristic is not readable**

Not all characeristics support `read`.
 
Your device must have configured this characteristic to support `read`.

**2. your bluetooth device turned off, or is out of range**

If your device turns off mid-read, it will cause a failure.

**3. your bluetooth device has bugs**

Maybe your device crashed, or is not sending a response due to software bugs.

**4. there is radio interference**

Bluetooth is wireless and will not always work.
