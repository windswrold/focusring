## 1.14.1
* Dart: improve: each FlutterBluePlusException should have unique code for handling

## 1.14.0
1.14.0 is a sizeable refactor of BluetoothDevice & Android bond handling to improve reliablility & error handling.
It also removes some changes regarding bond state made in 1.13.0, and instead exposes BluetoothDevice.bondState.
It is been well tested, but 1.12.14 is currently the most known-stable. 

* Android: expose BluetoothDevice.bondState & remove implicit waitIfBonding changes added in 1.13.0
* Android: prefer result.error over exceptions
* Dart: fix: BluetoothDevice: connect & disconnect and others could incorrectly timeout (unlikely race conditions) 
* Dart: fix: BluetoothDevice: getBondState, getMtu, getConnectionState could skip values (unlikely race conditions) 
* Dart: fix: clear servicesList after disconnection. Android requires you call discoverServices again
* Example: fix: Subscribe button was not updating
* Example: show snackbars on success as well

## 1.13.4
* Android: fix: discoverServices never returns (regression in 1.13.0)
* Android: fix: turnOn & turnOff must check for permissions

## 1.12.14
* Android: fix: min sdk is currently 21, not 19
* Android: fix: getOrDefault not available in AndroidSdkLevel < 24
* Android: log: BOND changes
* Android: rename: pair -> createBond

## 1.12.13
* iOS: fix: FlutterBluePlus.isAvailable 'int' is not a subtype of type 'FutureOr<bool>' (regressed in 1.12.10)

## 1.12.12
* Android: fix: null ptr deref during ScanResult connectionState (regressed in 1.10.6)
