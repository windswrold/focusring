**Note: this plugin is continuous work from FlutterBlue since maintenance stopped.**

## Foreward

For simple BLE apps, I highly recommend QuickBlue (https://pub.dev/packages/quick_blue) in favor of FlutterBlue. It has a simpler API, a much smaller codebase, is less buggy, and supports iOS, MacOS, Android, Windows, and partial Linux support.

## Introduction

FlutterBluePlus is a bluetooth plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), a new app SDK to help developers build modern multi-platform apps.

## Cross-Platform Bluetooth LE

FlutterBluePlus aims to offer the most from both platforms (iOS and Android).

Using the FlutterBluePlus instance, you can scan for and connect to nearby devices ([BluetoothDevice](#bluetoothdevice-api)).
Once connected to a device, the BluetoothDevice object can discover services ([BluetoothService](lib/src/bluetooth_service.dart)), characteristics ([BluetoothCharacteristic](lib/src/bluetooth_characteristic.dart)), and descriptors ([BluetoothDescriptor](lib/src/bluetooth_descriptor.dart)).
The BluetoothDevice object is then used to directly interact with characteristics and descriptors.

## Troubleshooting

The easiest way to debug issues in FlutterBluePlus is to first make local copy.

```
cd /user/downloads
git clone https://github.com/boskokg/flutter_blue_plus.git
```

then in `pubspec.yaml` add the repo by path:

```
  flutter_blue_plus:
    path: /user/downloads/flutter_blue_plus
```

Now you can edit FlutterBluePlus code and debug issues yourself. 

### When I scan using a service UUID filter, it doesn't find any devices.

Make sure the device is advertising which service UUID's it supports. This is found in the advertisement
packet as **UUID 16 bit complete list** or **UUID 128 bit complete list**.

## Usage

### Obtain an instance

```dart
FlutterBluePlus flutterBlue = FlutterBluePlus.instance;
```

### Scan for devices

```dart
// Start scanning
flutterBlue.startScan(timeout: Duration(seconds: 4));

// Listen to scan results
var subscription = flutterBlue.scanResults.listen((results) {
    // do something with scan results
    for (ScanResult r in results) {
        print('${r.device.localName} found! rssi: ${r.rssi}');
    }
});

// Stop scanning
flutterBlue.stopScan();
```

### Connect to a device

```dart
// Connect to the device
await device.connect();

// Disconnect from device
device.disconnect();
```

### Discover services

```dart
List<BluetoothService> services = await device.discoverServices();
services.forEach((service) {
    // do something with service
});
```

### Read and write characteristics

```dart
// Reads all characteristics
var characteristics = service.characteristics;
for(BluetoothCharacteristic c in characteristics) {
    List<int> value = await c.read();
    print(value);
}

// Writes to a characteristic
await c.write([0x12, 0x34])
```

### Read and write descriptors

```dart
// Reads all descriptors
var descriptors = characteristic.descriptors;
for(BluetoothDescriptor d in descriptors) {
    List<int> value = await d.read();
    print(value);
}

// Writes to a descriptor
await d.write([0x12, 0x34])
```

### Set notifications and listen to changes

```dart
await characteristic.setNotifyValue(true);
characteristic.onValueReceived.listen((value) {
    // do something with new value
});
```

### Read the MTU and request larger size

```dart
final mtu = await device.mtu.first;
await device.requestMtu(512);
```

Note that iOS will not allow requests of MTU size, and will always try to negotiate the highest possible MTU (iOS supports up to MTU size 185)

## Getting Started

### Change the minSdkVersion for Android

flutter_blue_plus is compatible only from version 19 of Android SDK so you should change this in **android/app/build.gradle**:

```dart
Android {
  defaultConfig {
     minSdkVersion: 19
```

### Add permissions for Bluetooth

We need to add the permission to use Bluetooth and access location:

#### **Android**

In the **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** let’s add:

```xml
	  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation" />
	  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
 <application
```

By default the package does not request the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission on Android 12+. In case you need to get the physical
location of the device via Bluetooth, you need to add the permission to the **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:

```xml
	  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
 <application
```

and set the androidUsesFineLocation flag to true when scanning:

```dart
// Start scanning
flutterBlue.startScan(timeout: Duration(seconds: 4), androidUsesFineLocation: true);

// Stop scanning
flutterBlue.stopScan();
```

#### **IOS**

In the **ios/Runner/Info.plist** let’s add:

```dart
	<dict>
	    <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need BLE permission</string>
	    <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need BLE permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
```

For location permissions on iOS see more at: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/requesting_authorization_for_location_services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/requesting_authorization_for_location_services)
